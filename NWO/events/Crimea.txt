    In 1954, due to impossibility to adequately supply the Crimean peninsula with electricity, food and most of production from Russia, it was decided by Presidiums of Supreme Soviets of Russian SFSR and Ukrainian SSR to transfer ethnically diverse (but mostly Russian) peninsula from Russia to Ukraine.
    The thing is Presidiums had no right to do so without positive votes from the Supreme Councils. Whether there was such votes there are still speculations to these days.
    Nobody cared while we were parts of one country, but now we may get a conflict because of Russian-populated peninsula become a part of another country.
    There are already activists from Crimea demanding for transfer to Russia. Kravchuk asks us if we're going to claim the peninsula. What should we tell him?"
